# Why use extensions?
The term extensions have been with us since the time of Objective-C but with Swift they're much more agile and capable.

Extensions in Swift has several different usages but one thing you can use them for is to extend the abilities of the current Apple frameworks you use everyday so that you can make more with them. For instance, access to the clear button image of that UITextField or return your version number from Bundle.

What makes extensions great is that they can be placed in a separate location so that they won't interfere with your project and mess it up.
