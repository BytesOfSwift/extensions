# What is this?
Hey there, welcome to Bytes of Swift,

an ever extending, community-driven resource for Swift extensions and snippets to maximize your productivity.

Bytes of Swift builds upon either the Swift Standard Library's solid foundations or Apple's custom frameworks to provide a better usage and come over various hassles.

# Key Features
## Type-Safe
Whenever possible, features to enable type-safety are applied/advised to avoid those pesky crashes and make your code easier to maintain.
## Best-Practices
Best practices of both coding in general and Swift are applied for the ultimate code performance and readability.
## Well Documented
Code samples here are well documented so that you can fully grasp what's going on.
## Included Examples
Since we make use of Swift Playgrounds, you can enjoy inline examples, where available, demonstrating the code sample you're browsing right there.

# Why use extensions?
The term extensions have been with us since the time of Objective-C but with Swift they're much more in the font lines.

Extensions in Swift has several different usages but one thing you can use them for is to extend the abilities of the current Apple frameworks you use everyday so that you can make more with them. For instance, access to the clear button image of that UITextField or return your version number from Bundle.

What makes extensions great is that they can be placed in a separate location so that they won't interfere with your project and mess it up.

# How to contribute?
If you have an extension idea or would like to provide a better alternative, please feel free to contribute.

You can also submit extensions you've come up on the internet by other developers. Stating the original developer as the author, of course.
